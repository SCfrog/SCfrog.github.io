    <h1>The Sticker Club</h1>
    <p>Stickers are a wonderful thing to have. They are decorative and useful. Sometimes, though, we just can't find the stickers that we want. If you want a specific picture, drawing, printout or image that you want on a sticker, you've come to the right place!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="Headers"><strong>What we do</strong></p>
    
    <p>The Sticker Club makes custom stickers with the secret sticker recipe. We can make <em>anything</em> into a sticker, if it follows these simple conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It must be school appropriate (unless you have special premission from an employee)</li>
        <li>It CANNOT be scary, creepy or offending in any way. ( Unless you have special premission from an employee.)</li>
        <li> If it is a gift, you have to say who it's for.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="Headers">Cost of each sticker</p>
    <p>Small trades are expected in return for your sticker</p>
